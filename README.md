# color-clock

## Objectives

This digital clock background is based on a hex gradient, which is obtained by converting hours, minutes, and seconds to the equivalent hex values. The hex gradient can be viewed by hovering over the time. Hex gradient constantly changes as the time changes.

Progress of each minute is shown as the image reduces in size.
